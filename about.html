				Hi, I'm Lindsay Garcia and I'm a portrait photographer - I like to take pictures of people. I enjoy working with kids, families, and couples and getting people to feel at ease so I can create art for them. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I first discovered my love of photography in high school and decided to work at a local studio to help develop my skills. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in photography. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm a free lance photographer based out of Orange County, California.
